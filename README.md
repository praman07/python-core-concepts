# Python Core Concepts

By: Praman07

This repository contains all the core Python concept files that I studied and practiced while learning Python.  
I started learning Python from scratch, covering each fundamental and advanced topic in a structured and hands-on way.

The repo includes:

- Basic syntax, variables, strings
- Loops (`for`, `while`, nested)
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- All types of operators
- Functions (user-defined and built-in)
- Important modules like `math`, `random`, and `os.path`
- Data structures (Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries) with traversal
- Exception handling
- File handling (read, write, append, create)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in detail:
  - Classes and Objects
  - Constructors and Destructors
  - Types of Attributes and Methods (class, instance, static)
  - Inheritance
  - Encapsulation
  - Polymorphism (including duck typing)
  - Abstraction
  - Dunder (Magic) Methods
- Decorators and the role of wrappers

This repo is a complete reference for anyone starting with Python and aiming to build strong foundational understanding of its core concepts.
